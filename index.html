            <p> Hi, I'm Ruben (the goof in the image to the left) and this is my portfolio. I am an inspiring software engineer currently attending UCF for Computer Science (previously Biomedical Science) and using the coding bootcamp as a tool to boost me into an early position as a junior engineer somewhere. My hobbies are watching Anime, Running, Video Games, and occasionally collecting watches on the side. For clearity: favorite game - Hollow Knight, favorite Anime - Steins; Gate, fastest 5K was 21:23, and currently looking into buying a Omega Speedmaster. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. </p>
